		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Stedman is a commonly rung odd-bell method, which has much musical potential and a structure that extends easily to higher stages. The place starts and the dodges in 4/5, 6/7, etc give the method a similar feel to Grandsire in some ways, but Stedman also contains pieces of work not found in commonly rung Plain methods, as well as wrong hunting. Ropesight is also tricky, there is no hunt bell to provide structure, and Stedman is difficult to conduct-so in many ways it is more tricky for a band to ring than simpler Surprise methods.</p>
		<p>We’ll consider Stedman Triples. Learning the line for other stages is straightforward once the basic structure is known, as is explained later on, but note in particular that Stedman Doubles has very different calls (Singles) to other stages.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="col-wide left">
		<p>At a high level the method consists of double-dodging at the back, and plain hunting on 3 at the front. The method is divided into blocks of 6 changes. In a "slow six" the bells on the front hunt wrong; in a "quick six", right.</p>
		<p>At each “six end” the bells at the back move between dodging positions while the bells on the front change direction.</p>
		<p>This structure results in two different 'frontworks', one 'quick' (which the treble starts in the middle of) and one 'slow' (which 4ths place bell enters at the start and finishes 2½ leads later), with sections of double-dodging in between.</p>

		<p>Although in theory this section is made up of alternating blocks of right and wrong plain hunting, it is more commonly learnt as a single long piece of work.</p>
		<p>Make 3rds on the way in (which switches you into wrong hunting), and then do the first "whole turn"—lead, point, lead. Note that the first lead is back/hand and the second is hand/back (the point 2nds switches you back into right hunting).</p>
		<p>The next section is "3rds, point lead, 3rds, point lead, 3rds". The points are often referred to as a "half turns". The first of which is at handstroke, and the second at backstroke. It is worth carefully counting your place while you get used to the swaps between wrong and right hunting.</p>
		<p>Come down to do another whole turn—lead, point, lead. This time with the first lead at hand/back and the second at back/hand.</p>
		<p>Finish by not forgetting to make 3rds on the way out to the backwork.</p>

		<p>The backwork consists of everything above 3rd place, which you’ll see consists of double-dodging in each dodging position up to the back and all the way down to the front again.</p>
		<p>This is more difficult that it looks, because unlike Plain Bob or similar, the bells don’t come down from the back (or up from the front) in a particularly predictable pattern. This is due to the bells going in quick “overtaking” bells which have gone in slow and muddling the coursing order. The transitions between dodging positions are the most difficult part. Tapping through the line on-screen won’t help much here unfortunately, but with practice comes experience.</p>

		<h2>In Quick or In Slow?</h2>
		<p>As the backwork is identical regardless of the frontwork there is ample opportunity for confusion about whether you are going in quick or in slow, particularly after a bob or single. This has been the subject of many an article, and everyone has their favourite way to remember. We’ll walk through a few common methods:</p>
		<h3>Count Bobs/Singles and Just Remember</h3>
		<p>In a plain course you will always go in the other way to last time. Each bob that is called swaps the way that you will go in next time, and each Single has no effect.</p>
		<p>You may find it difficult to keep track, in which case one of the below methods may be useful.</p>
		<h3>Listen to / Watch the Leading</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="col-wide left">
		<p>When you are dodging in 4/5-down note which way around the bells on the front are leading: right (hand/back) or wrong (back/hand).</p>
		<p>If they're leading right then they're ringing a quick six and you will go in slow. If they're leading wrong then they're ringing a slow six and you’ll go in quick.</p>
		<p>This method could be extended to work at your 6/7, 8/9, etc dodges as well. If the bells on the front are leading right when you are dodging in 6/7, then in two sixes time you will go in quick (and vice versa).</p>

		<h2>Ringing on Other Stages</h2>
		<p>Extending Stedman to other stages is straightford in theory. Simply remove or add extra sets of double dodging at the back as shown in the lines below.</p>
		<p>In practice, ringing the method on higher stages is more difficult particularly in the backwork, where ropesight gets even harder as the number of bells increases.</p>

		<h3>Calls in Stedman Doubles</h3>
		<p>Stedman Doubles doesn't have Bobs, and the Singles are completely different to the Singles on other stages.</p>
		<p>Singles are made in the middle of a six by the bells that were to dodge in 4/5 making a place instead and picking up each other’s work. This results in pieces of work known as 'Cat’s Ears' and 'Coathangers' (other names exist), and after doing each you go back in the same way that you came out.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>Stedman is a difficult method, but hopefully the tutorial has helped with some of the learning so you can make the most of any practical experience you're able to get.</p>
		<p>Stedman doesn't really lead on to any other commonly rung practice-night methods. You might consider learning Erin or Shipway to challenge a quarter peal band; they are also principles and share some similarities with Stedman. Erin also has the advantage that Plain Bob coursing order is maintained, so less experienced bands might find it easier to ring than Stedman ono higher stages.</p>
