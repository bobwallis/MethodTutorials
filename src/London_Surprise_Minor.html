		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>London is a commonly rung Surprise Minor method. Either as the standard 'more difficult than Cambridge' practice-night method, or as a basis for moving on to the many other Surprise Minor methods rung in spliced.</p>

		<p>The method contains several pieces of work you may not have encountered before: point leads, fishtails and whole-turns being the most obvious. There is also plenty of wrong-hunting. Ringing a more 'Cambridge-like' method that has some of this work (Beverley or Surfleet perhaps) before moving on to London might be beneficial to avoid too much new stuff at once.</p>
		<p>If you haven't encountered wrong-hunting before, this is where you are hunting backwards—i.e. lead at handstroke then at backtroke, ringing in even places at backstroke on the way up and handstroke on the way down, etc. This can take some getting used to.</p>
		<p>In London the treble is treble-bobbing as usual in Surprise, and so is always 'right'. A bell hunting wrong can't cross the path of a bell hunting right since they would clash, so London contains lots of single-places and points to swap the working bells from wrong to right when they need to work with the treble.</p>
		<p>This tutorial will guide you through learning the method lead-by-lead, Similar to the Cambridge tutorial and for the same reasons.</p>

		<h2>2nds Place Bell</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="col-wide left">
		<p>This lead is superficially similar to Cambridge, with the first half containing the “forwards” half of the front work, before you move on to work at the back. Start the lead with: "dodge, lead, second, point lead".</p>
		<p>The point at the end of the frontwork swaps you from hunting 'right' to hunting 'wrong', so to pass the treble (which is always hunting 'right') you must make a place—do so in 4ths.</p>
		<p>The work at the back is sometimes call 'Long London': Dodge, lie,  fishtail, lie. It will be less confusing if you don't think of the fishtail as being a double-dodge.</p>
		<p>Finish the lead by hunting back down, and becoming 3rds place bell.</p>

		<h2>Calls</h2>
		<p>Calls are in theory the same as Plain Bob and are done by swapping the 12 lead end to 14 (Bob) or 1234 (Single). This results in a bell making 4ths and the front bells either running in/out (in a Bob) or making a place (in a Single).</p>
		<p>It is well worth making sure you have learnt what to do at the end of each lead as well as what to do at the start. Unlike in Plain Bob or Cambridge, the work preceding and/or following the lead end consists of wrong hunting or making a place. This results in the calls feeling very different to methods you may have rung already. Although as you have learnt each lead separately you should hopefully know when the end of the lead is approaching, and be able to use your knowledge of place starts to quickly pick up the line after the call.</p>
		<h3>Bob</h3>
		<p>If you are about to make 2nds in the middle of the frontwork, then instead run out and become 3rds place bell (make 3rds on the way up to a 5/6 fishtail). If you are just coming down from the a 5/6 fishtail, have made 3rds and are about to turn around, then run in and pick up 2nds place bell (frontwork). If you are coming down from Long London, then make 4ths instead of 3rds, and turn around to do Long London the other way around.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>Hopefully this tutorial has helped with some of the learning so you can make the most of any practical experience you're able to get.</p>
		<p>Being able to competently ring London and Cambridge should give you enough confidence to try any other Minor method. If you're looking for other Surprise methods to try then Wells is a good 'London-over' method with different frontwork. Or you might want to try Norwich or Carlisle so you have covered all four of the over-works in the Standard 41 Surprise Minor.</p>
