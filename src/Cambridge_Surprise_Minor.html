		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Cambridge is the most commonly rung Surprise Minor method. Ringing Cambridge is a big step-up from plain methods like Plain Bob or Grandsire, but it can be broken down to be made easier to learn.</p>

		<p>It's tempting to try to learn the method as chunks of work joined up by hunting and dodging (perhaps assisted by noticing that the method is symmetrical). This might seem like a logical process to follow after learning rules-based methods like Plain Bob (pass the treble in X, do Y) or Kent (dodge unless the treble is below you in 3/4), but this tutorial will instead guide you through learning the method lead-by-lead. This will mean:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You know all the place starts, so bobs and singles are easier.</li>
			<li>You can ring any bell without having to look up where to start.</li>
			<li>When people say things like “you’ll be become 5ths place bell at backstroke!” their words make sense.</li>
			<li>Ringing spliced is a less daunting prospect.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Let's consider each lead in turn.</p>

		<h2>2nds Place Bell (Frontwork)</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="col-wide left">
		<p>The first half of 2nds place bell contains the “forwards” half of Cambridge front work, which goes: “Dodge, lead seconds, dodge lead, dodge”. Note that the seconds is over the same bell as you then immediately dodge with (there is nowhere else for them to go), and that the final dodge of the front work happens at the half-lead (when the treble lies behind).</p>
		<p>Finish the lead by hunting to the back, double-dodging up and then dodging down at the lead end to become 6ths place bell. You may find it useful to remember that the double-dodge goes on the side closest to the front work.</p>

		<p>The 2nd half of this lead is filled by Cambridge Places in 3/4 up, but the lead begins by hunting down to the front, leading and, dodging up. You may find it helpful to remember that the dodge is on the same side of the lead as the places.</p>
		<p>The places themselves go: “dodge, far place, near place, dodge, far place, near place, dodge”.</p>
		<p>Observe how the middle dodge of the places is always with the treble, the first and last place are over/under the treble’s dodge, the first is at the half-lead, and the last dodge is at the lead-end. This structure provides some helpful checkpoints.</p>
		<p>The lead finishes at the last dodge of the places, and you  become 3rds place bell.</p>

		<p>3rds place bell consists entirely of what is referred to as "the backwork", and starts at the dodge at the end of the 3/4 places up.</p>
		<p>You double-dodge up, lie, and dodge down with the treble. You then make 5ths under the treble at the half lead and do the same backwards. Dodge up, lie, double-dodge down and go down to start 3/4 places down.</p>
		<p>You'll probably find this to be one of the more straightforward parts of the method once you get the hang of the interaction with the treble. Being at the back gives you an easy view over all the other bells.</p>
