		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Cambridge Major is a logical extension of Cambridge Minor and much of the work is shared between the two methods.  Cambridge Major inserts a lead with places in 5ths and 6ths between the front work and the places in 3rds and 4ths.  It can be broken down to be made easier to learn.</p>

		<p>It's tempting to try to learn the method as a single long line, with chunks of work joined up by hunting and dodging (perhaps assisted by noticing that the method is symmetrical). This might seem like a logical approach after learning rules-based methods like Plain Bob (pass the treble in X, do Y) or Kent (dodge unless the treble is below you in 3/4), but this tutorial will instead guide you through learning the method lead-by-lead with an emphasis on noting where the place starts occur. This will mean:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You know all the place starts, so bobs and singles are easier.</li>
			<li>You can ring any bell without having to look up where to start.</li>
			<li>When people say things like “you’ll be become 5ths place bell at backstroke!” their words make sense.</li>
			<li>Ringing spliced is a less daunting prospect.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Let's consider each lead in turn.</p>

		<h2>2nds Place Bell (Frontwork)</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="col-wide left">
		<p>The first half of 2nds place bell contains the “forward” half of Cambridge frontwork, which goes: “Dodge, lead, seconds, dodge, lead, dodge” the same as minor. Note that the seconds is over the same bell as you then immediately dodge with (there is nowhere else for them to go). The difference over minor occurs at the half-lead when you do a 3/4 up dodge as you hunt up to the back.</p>
		<p>At the back, double-dodge up, lie and then dodge down and start hunt back down to a 5/6 dodge at the lead end to become 6ths place bell. You may find it useful to remember that the double-dodge goes on the side closest to the frontwork.</p>

		<h3>Bob</h3>
		<p>If you are about to make 2nds in the middle of the frontwork, then instead run out and become 3rds place bell (backwork). If you are just coming down from the backwork and about do 3/4 places down, then run in and pick up 2nds place bell (frontwork). If you are coming to the end of 3/4 places up, then make 4ths instead of the final dodge, become 4ths place bell, and then do 3/4 places down (without the dodge at the start).</p>

		<h3>Single</h3>
		<p>If you are just coming down from the backwork and about to start 3/4 places down, then make 3rds (over the bell making 2nds), then turn around and do the backwork again. If you're doing the frontwork then you're unaffected by a single. If you are coming to the end of 3/4 places up, then you make 4ths instead of the final dodge in the same way as in a bob (although both blows in 4ths are over the same bell).</p>
